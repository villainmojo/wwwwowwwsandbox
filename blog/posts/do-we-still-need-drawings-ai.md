excerpt: BIM is becoming the standard, yet we still end with 2D drawings. In an AI-and-robotics future, should drawings remain the core deliverable—or should models become the language of construction?

BIM is rapidly becoming a standard tool across the construction industry. More and more projects are being designed and delivered using BIM workflows. Yet, most BIM projects still end at the same point: producing 2D drawings for construction.

In the age of AI, is this process still fundamentally necessary?

As we move closer to an era of AGI and physical AI—where robots and automated systems increasingly participate in construction—the primary executor of construction work may no longer be human.

In South Korea, the average daily wage for construction labor is around USD 190. At the same time, skilled workers are becoming harder to find, and labor shortages on construction sites are becoming structural rather than temporary. If construction robots can operate 24/7, reduce safety risks, and be deployed at a cost lower than daily human labor, should we still be designing our workflows around human-readable drawings?

Robots do not read drawings. They learn from and execute based on models.

And that raises another question: will humans always need to create those models?

With generative AI, computer vision, and simulation technologies advancing rapidly, BIM models themselves may no longer be manually authored artifacts. They could be generated, validated, and optimized by AI—based on requirements, constraints, and performance goals. Humans, meanwhile, are becoming increasingly comfortable reviewing, coordinating, and making decisions directly in 3D environments, rather than through traditional 2D documentation.

Perhaps drawings will not disappear—but their role may fundamentally change.

And perhaps BIM models will evolve from something humans create into something humans curate, verify, and approve.

In the AI era, BIM should evolve from a tool that produces drawings into a construction language that does not assume drawings—or even human-authored models—as the final output.

The real question is: **how should we redefine deliverables in the age of AI-driven construction?**
